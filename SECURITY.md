# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability
**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, report a vulnerability through the [GitHub Security Advisories][security_advisories_new]
feature. You can also manually reach this section by navigating to the project's
repository page on GitHub > _Security_ tab > _Advisories_ under _Reporting_ >
_Report a vulnerability_.

Alternatively, email opensource@mateiradu.dev and include the word "SECURITY"
in the subject line.
